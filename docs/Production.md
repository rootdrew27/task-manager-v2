# Next.js Production Optimization Guide

This document includes instructions and general notes on preparing a Next.js application for production, based on 2025 best practices and official Next.js recommendations.

## Core Performance Optimizations

### Built-in Next.js Features
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits code by pages, reducing bundle sizes
- **Route Prefetching**: Links are prefetched when they enter the viewport for faster navigation
- **Automatic Static Optimization**: Static pages are generated automatically when possible

### Image Optimization
Use `next/image` component for:
- Automatic format conversion (WebP, AVIF)
- Responsive sizing based on device
- Native lazy loading
- Priority loading for critical images
- Quality and sizing fine-tuning

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/example.jpg"
  alt="Example image"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority // For above-the-fold images
/>
```

### Font Optimization
- Use Next.js Font Module to automatically host font files
- Eliminates external network requests
- Reduces layout shift
- Automatic font optimization

## Rendering Strategies

### Hybrid Rendering Approach
Combine different strategies based on content needs:

- **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: For static content that doesn't change frequently
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: For dynamic content requiring server interactions
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: For content needing periodic updates
- **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**: For highly interactive components

### Server Components
- Leverage React Server Components for reduced client-side JavaScript
- Improve performance by running components on the server
- Better SEO and faster initial page loads

## Code Optimization

### Dynamic Imports and Lazy Loading Components
```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false // Disable server-side rendering if needed
})
```

### Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm install @next/bundle-analyzer
npm run analyze
```

### Dependency Management
- Remove unused dependencies with tools like `depcheck`
- Use Import Cost extension to monitor package sizes
- Check Bundle Phobia and Package Phobia for dependency impact

## Performance Monitoring

### Core Web Vitals
Focus on these key metrics:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**: < 200ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

### Monitoring Tools
- **Lighthouse**: For performance auditing
- **Chrome UX Report (CrUX)**: Real user metrics
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Production performance tracking

## Security

### Application Headers

#### CSP Header
- Implement Content Security Policy to protect against XSS, clickjacking, and code injection attacks
- Configure proper directives for scripts, styles, and resources

#### HSTS Header
- Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security for HTTPS enforcement
- Prevent protocol downgrade attacks

### Prevent Data Leakage
- Secure API routes and database connections

## Advanced Optimizations

### Edge Functions
- Deploy API routes and middleware to edge locations
- Reduce latency with location-aware execution
- Better performance for global users

### Third-Party Scripts
Use `next/script` component for optimized loading:
```jsx
import Script from 'next/script'

<Script
  src="https://example.com/script.js"
  strategy="lazyOnload" // or "afterInteractive", "beforeInteractive"
/>
```

### Caching Strategies
- Implement proper cache headers
- Use Redis for API caching
- Leverage ISR for dynamic content caching
- Configure CDN caching rules

## Production Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
1. Run `next build` locally to catch build errors
2. Test with `next start` for production-like performance
3. Run Lighthouse audits on key pages
4. Analyze bundle sizes with bundle analyzer
5. Check for unused dependencies

## Logging
- Categorical (Database, Auth, Security, Performance, etc.)
- Use appropriate log levels and rotation

## Availability

### Rate Limiting
- Implement sliding window rate limiting
- Use Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Configure different limits for different endpoints
