# Tasks (not to be confused with the tasks in the application)

## Agent 
- Profiling needed
- Add tools for deleting all (and others that would be quicker than having the model generate X tool calls)

## UI
- [ ] The Agent Chat and the Tasks should be scrollable
- [ ] Add simple buttons for adding and deleting. Make task names, deadline, etc. editable.
- [ ] Setup toasts

## API Key Validation
- [x] Split the process into two modals (validation then model selection)
- [ ] Add toasts for success

## Guest Sessions
- [ ] Save API keys and model selections (in database).
