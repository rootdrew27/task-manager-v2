# Tasks (not to be confused with the tasks in the application)

## Agent 
- Profiling needed
- Add tools for deleting all (and others that would be quicker than having the model generate X tool calls)

## UI
- The Agent Chat and the Tasks should be scrollable
- Add simple buttons for adding and deleting. Make task names, deadline, etc. editable.
